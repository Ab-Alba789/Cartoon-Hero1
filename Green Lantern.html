    <h2>About Green Lantern</h2>
    <p>Green lantern, aka, Hal Jordan, is one of many members of the Green Lantern Corps as well as the Justice League. 
        He gets his powers from a Ring fueled by Willpower. 
        Jordan was a second-generation test pilot, having followed in the footsteps of his father. 
        He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying alien named Abin Sur, 
        whose spaceship crashed on Earth. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was 
        "utterly honest and born without fear" to take his place as a member of the Corps.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The signature power of all Green Lanterns (to include Hal Jordan) is the ability to conjure "constructs:" 
            solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically. These can be anything, 
            such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, 
            or chains to bind a prisoner.</li>
            <br>
        <li>The ring is powered by willpower. Each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. 
            The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent 
            traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.</li>
            <br>
        <li>The effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will beat a 
            weaker-willed Lantern in a duel. Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, 
            may render his ring useless.</li>
    </ol>
