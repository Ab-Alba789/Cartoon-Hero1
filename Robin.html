        <h2>About Robin</h2>
        <p>Robin (Tim Drake) is Batman's 3rd sidekick. He helps Batman fight crime in Gotham City. After the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, 
            Tim attempted to convince the original Robin, Dick Grayson to resume the role of Robin stating that 
            "Batman needs a Robin". However Dick did not take back the role of Robin and instead Tim was appointed 
            to become the third Robin. Prior to becoming Robin, Tim Drake had trained in martial arts and was a capable, if inexperienced, combatant. 
            Bruce Wayne built upon this foundation by initially replicating the training he used for both Dick Grayson 
            and Jason Todd, formally training in several fighting styles.</p>

        <h2> Characteristics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>As a young boy, Tim was in the audience the night <a href="/Nightwing.html">Dick Grayson's</a> parents were murdered and 
                later managed to discover the identities of <a href="/index.html">Batman</a> and the original Robin through their exploits.</li>
                <br>
            <li>
                Tim also trained in non-combat skills, such as gymnastics and free climbing, to further develop his athleticism. 
                While this echoed the training of previous Robins, Bruce slanted the training with a greater emphasis on stealth tactics, 
                ranged combat, and better defense. In his early exploits, Tim frequently demonstrated this training by attacking from 
                the shadows, using a sling for extra distance, and relying more heavily on throwing shuriken</li>
                <br>
            <li>Idolizing Batman and Robin, Drake trained from a young age in fields such as acrobatics, forensics, detective work and 
                criminology. The most intellectually gifted of the Robins, Drake has deduced a majority of other heroes' identities, 
                including the Flash and <a href="/Superman.html">Superman</a>. In addition, after foiling Ra's al Ghul's master plan to assassinate everyone 
                Bruce Wayne cared about and ruining the Wayne Family fortune, Ra's has addressed Tim as "Detective," a title the 
                villain once only reserved for Bruce Wayne. His intellect has enabled him to excel in computer science and a grasp of 
                assorted scientific techniques, including biology, engineering, and genetics. Tim also speaks several languages beyond 
                his native English, including Cantonese, Russian, Spanish and German. Even <a href="/Nightwing.html">Nightwing</a> is proud of his skills, 
                saying that Tim was a better Robin than he was.</li>
        </ol>
