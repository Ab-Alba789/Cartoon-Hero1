        <h2>About Superman</h2>
        <p>Superman is superhero born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. 
            As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. 
            His ship landed in the American countryside, near the town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers 
            Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, 
            such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit 
            of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. He is one of the founding members of the Justice League.
