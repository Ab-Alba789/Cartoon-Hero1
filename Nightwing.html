        <h2>About Nightwing</h2>

        <p>Formerly Batman's 1st sidekick, Robin, Nightwing (AKA Dick Grayson) is a crimefighting vigilante who is trying to do things 
            his way. Grayson establishes himself as the leader of the Teen Titans, a team of teenage superheroes. As a young man, 
            he retires as Robin and takes on his own superhero identity to assert his independence, becoming Nightwing.</p>

                He is able to anticipate and predict one's next action and detect if someone is lying. Like Batman, he also possesses a will 
                strong enough to withstand even telepathic attacks.</li>
